# Identity Management

Use this skill to query and manage git identities via the RemoteJuggler Chapel tools exposed through rj-gateway.

## Identity Query
- `juggler_status()` returns current identity context, auth status, and active configuration
- `juggler_list_identities(provider="all")` lists all configured identities across providers
- `juggler_config_show()` displays the full RemoteJuggler configuration

## Identity Validation
- `juggler_validate(identity="rj-agent-bot")` tests SSH + credential connectivity for a given identity
- Validates: SSH key exists, SSH auth succeeds, token is valid, GPG signing available

## Token Management
- `juggler_token_verify()` verifies the current token's validity and scopes
- `juggler_token_get()` retrieves the active token for the current identity

## GPG & Signing
- `juggler_gpg_status()` checks GPG/SSH signing readiness
- Reports: signing key availability, trust level, expiry status

## Bot Identity Details
- Identity name: `rj-agent-bot`
- GitHub App ID: 2945224
- SSH key path: `/home/agent/.ssh/id_ed25519`
- Email: `2945224+rj-agent-bot[bot]@users.noreply.github.com`

## Identity Drift Detection
When running identity audits:
1. Query current identity with `juggler_status()`
2. Compare against expected state in IDENTITY.md
3. Flag any discrepancies: wrong key, expired token, missing GPG
4. Log findings for the identity audit campaign
