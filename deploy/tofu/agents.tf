# Agent Plane — shared resources and legacy aliases
# =============================================================================
#
# Individual agent deployments are in their own files:
#   - ironclaw.tf  (IronClaw — OpenClaw fork, replaces homegrown openclaw)
#   - picoclaw.tf  (PicoClaw — lightweight agent for scan campaigns)
#   - hexstrike.tf (HexStrike-AI — security testing agent)
#
# This file contains shared resources used by all agents.
# =============================================================================

# Agent SSH identity keys (shared secret across all agent pods)
# Keys are resolved from Setec via apply.sh and stored as a K8s secret.
# Each agent mounts its own sub_path (e.g. ironclaw-id-ed25519).
