# Campaigns

Campaigns are declarative JSON definitions that describe automated tasks for agents to execute. Each campaign specifies triggers, tools, process steps, guardrails, and success metrics.

## Campaign Definition Schema

Campaign definitions are JSON files in `test/campaigns/`. Key fields:

```json
{
  "id": "campaign-id",
  "name": "Human-Readable Name",
  "agent": "openclaw|hexstrike|claude-code",
  "trigger": {
    "schedule": "0 6 * * 1",
    "event": "manual|push|pull_request|dependent",
    "dependsOn": ["other-campaign-id"],
    "pathFilters": ["gateway/*.go"]
  },
  "tools": ["juggler_campaign_status", "github_fetch"],
  "process": ["Step 1: ...", "Step 2: ..."],
  "guardrails": {
    "maxDuration": "15m",
    "readOnly": true,
    "killSwitch": "remotejuggler/campaigns/global-kill",
    "aiApiBudget": { "maxTokens": 30000 }
  },
  "feedback": {
    "createIssues": true,
    "closeResolvedIssues": true
  },
  "metrics": {

  }
}
```

## Execution Flow

1. **Campaign Runner** evaluates triggers every 60 seconds
2. Due campaigns are dispatched to the appropriate agent
3. Agent executes process steps using MCP tools through rj-gateway
4. Results are stored in Setec (latest + timestamped history)
5. Feedback handler creates/closes GitHub issues for findings
6. Publisher posts sanitized results to GitHub Discussions
7. README agent status table is updated via repository_dispatch
